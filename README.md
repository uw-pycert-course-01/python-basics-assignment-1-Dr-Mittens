# Assignment 1: Starter exercises

## Objectives
1. The objective of this assignment is to allow you to familiarize yourself 
with the basics of Python.
## Instructions
1. Complete each of the the tasks below and submit them for grading.
### Basics
1. Create 3 variables and assign them a value.
    1. Create a variable called `my_string` and assign it a string value
    1. Create a variable called `my_integer` and assign it an integer value
    1. Create a variable called `my_float` and assign it a float value
1. Create two new integer variables with any values.
    1. Write code to add those variables, storing the result in a third variable. 
    1. In a comment, write what you expect the value of the third variable to be.
    1. Print out the value of the third variable to verify that it has the correct value.
1. Create two new float variables with any values.
    1. Write code to add those variables, storing the result in a third variable. 
    1. In a comment, write what you expect the value of the third variable to be.
    1. Print out the value of the third variable to verify that it has the correct value.
1. Create two new string variables with any values.
    1. Write code to add those variables, storing the result in a third variable.
    1. In a comment, write what you expect the value of the third variable to be.
    1. Print out the value of the third variable to verify that it has the correct value.
1. Add any integer variable and any float variable from the previous steps, storing the result in a third variable. 
    1. In a comment, write what you expect the value of the third variable to be.
    1. Print out the value of the third variable to verify that it has the correct value.
    1. In a comment, write what you expect the type of the third variable to be.
1. Add any integer variable and any string variable from the previous steps, storing the result in a third variable. 
    1. In a comment, write what you expect the value of the third variable to be.
    1. Print out the value of the third variable to verify that it has the correct value.
    1. In a comment, write what the output value was and an explanation of why that is.
    1. Comment out the line of code and go on to the next section.

For next steps you are going to use Python functions beyond `print`.

Functions can accept input and may return a result. For example, `print` takes 
a message to display on the screen, but other than doing that, doesn’t return 
any results that we need for now.

Other useful functions are `str`, which converts a number to a str, `round`, 
which takes a number and count of decimals places, and returns the number 
rounded (so `round(6.4352, 3)` returns 6.46. Also `type` takes any variable name 
and returns its type.

### Try these tasks now (in the same python file you're working in):
1. Print out the types of my_string, my_integer, and my_float.
1. Create a string variable and assign it an integer value (value should be in quotes).
    1. Print out the type of the new variable to verify it is a string 
    1. Cast that variable to an integer and store it in a new variable
    1. Print out the type of the new variable to verify that it is now an integer
1. Multiply 5 by 7.654321 and round to 3 decimal places. Print out the resulting value.
1. Use the `input` function to display a message that says “Enter your name” and places the result in a variable called `my_name`. 
    1. Print out the resulting value.
3. Use the `input` function to display a message that says “Enter your favorite number” and places the result in a variable called `favorite_number`.
    1. Print out the resulting value
    1. In a comment, write what you expect the type of `favorite_number` is.
    1. Print out the type of `favorite_number`
    1. In a comment, write down the output and an explanation of why that is. Hint, you may need to search up "python documentation input"
1. Now, ask the user for two integers (use the input function twice).
    1. Store the sum of the two numbers in a third variable
    1. In a comment, write what you expect the value of the third variable to be.
    1. Print out the value of the third variable.
    1. In a comment, write what the output value was and an explanation of why that is.
    1. Write code that does proper addition with the two numbers and stores it into a fourth variable
    1. Print out that fourth variable to verify it does the propert addition.
